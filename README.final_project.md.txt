This project was my final BIA task; my focus of the buiness problem was directed towards resturant popularity and the revenue generation.  Insights are gleamed from the visualzations utilized through the use of Tableau.

Restaurant/Customer Revenue Report




Restaurant Popularity (Not all restaurants provided in the dataset had provided rating values, thus these were filtered out from the visuals):

1.) Rating of the restaurant was ranged between 3.1 to 4.6 when looking at the Top 10 average restaurant prices.  Additionally, of the top 5 restaurants, the lowest rating was 4.1.

2.) Most of the restaurant pricing was roughly around the $700 mark (restaurants 6-10); a larger variance of price range was noted with the top 4 restaurants (also of which, this grouping had a rating no lower than 4.1) from $870 - >$1,000.
		Desserts/Bakery/Cake were the largest cuisine similarities of the Top 10 restaurants; thus, it could be stated higher rated restaurants could be resulted from their menus being tailored towards a sweet palate.

3.) Geologically based (specifically within India) higher rated restaurants (if established as 4.0 or greater) are not specific to any particular region.  This shows, there is close to no bias of location being a high influential factor for higher ratings.
	Also, region did not seem to have large clusters of similarities of cuisine.  (Although of the utilized dataset, not all polled restaurants had cuisine, along with respective city, entered in the needed fields.) 





Revenue: 
1.) In terms of Revenue, the restaurants were not able to be directly connected to the data utilized.  The ID for the respective locations were not fulfilled in the respective sales/orders data sets.  However, Customers themselves were able to be analyzed in certain demographics.

2.) Avg age was ranged between late 22 year olds and 30 year olds when looking at the typical sales quantity of the customers.  
	Compared to the other occupations, Students made up the highest proportion of high volume sales quantities (nearly doubling the second closest occupation.). When looking at the distribution of Monthly income of these groups, there was no stand out of monthly income being an unique influential factor.
	It could be shown as a correlation that the influence of the sales quantities were due to the amount of students who frequented the cataloged restaurants (their grouping had roughly 23,000 more unique users compared to the second highest group).

3.) In terms of Sales amounts connections were able to be established with the polled customers.  Of the top percentage of customers in terms of their average sales orders, no specific patterns in terms of their age or monthly income were noted, a variance among the top sales orders can be seen.
	Of the family demographics for the customers no discernible patterns were noted with the individuals in the family (size) and in relation to any revenue aspects.  However, in respect to martial status, those preferring not to answer on marriage  did have the highest average sales (grouped as employed, house wife, and self employed) in comparison to those who ID as married or single.  Also, the avg. age of those who prefer not to answer was higher in relation to the other two groups. 
	However, it can be noted the top average sales graphed from the period (2017-2020) can show all but one customer being in the years of 2017 & 2018 (with a larger grouping of customers being within 2018).  Only one top Avg sale was done in 2020.
	Further going into Monthly sales (and graphing based upon quarterly reports from 2017-2020) it illustrates there has been a steady decrease in total sales.  This is representative for all customers, in terms of their monthly income.

4.) Further potential insights could be established from following up with the top customers and contacting through the provided emails.  Through this added contact, potential for clarification on the drop off of sales, along with possible preferences for restaurants could be established (thus allowing for restaurants to change as needed).
